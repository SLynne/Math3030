Project for Math Modeling course at Georgia State University, Summer 2017.

This program finds the vector between two points, the cross product, the plane equation. Points A, B, and C are taken in as arrays of size 3 and are populated with user input. Points D1 and D2 are taken in as a single array of size 2. 

1) Determin whether 3 points A, B, C are collinear (i.e. lie in the same line).
2) If A, B, C are not collinear, find the plan that contains the three points.
3) Determine whether D1 and D2 are on the same side of the ABC-plane.
